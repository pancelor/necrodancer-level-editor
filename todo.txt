think about how to put multiple things on a single grid square. probably have 2 grids- one for tiles, one for entities. And entities definitely need to be able to stack
    new placeholder sprite that holds multipls sprites
    implement dragging as lifting all grid elems up into a new "grid" that you then drag around, and it gets pasted back down when you unclick

recent spites panel... also maybe a middle-click option

remove shopkeeper ghost?

choose what to do when you try to drag off-grid... probably just don't let it happen. awkward because now selections have to know about the grid again...
    well they kinda do already... (PIX)

get rid of eraser tool? maybe keep it in the UI but it's just painting with undefined...

selection drag for make copies (mcedit-style)

right-click on active selection = context menu with options to rotate/flip/etc

why do I need to refresh once for images to work?

create app cache
    http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html5_app_cache.asp
    save levels in here
        also display notice that they should try downloading a level first to be sure it works (?)

add images somewhere so the .io page will work

    apparently just push them on the gh-pages branch???:

moving can be transparent or non-transparent (checkbox to choose?)

low priority:
    interpolate between mouse events so you don't skip (e.g. placing rails in minecraft)
    add alternate names (e.g. "beetle" for "skeletontank")
        nvm skeletank is just extra... ugh
        filter out stuff like this?
    make select rectangles highlight _the sprite_, not just the square
    ctrl+a
    flood fill is really slow... some of it is drawing but some is the algorithm
    drag icons onto mouse picture to bind mouse buttons
