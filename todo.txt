choose what to do when you try to drag off-grid... probably just don't let it happen. awkward because now selections have to know about the grid again...
    well they kinda do already... (PIX)

right-click on active selection = context menu with options to rotate/flip/etc

create app cache

add images somewhere so the .io page will work

    downloading, including drag-drop

drag icons onto mouse picture to bind mouse buttons

flood fill is really slow... some of it is drawing but some is the algorithm

some sprites don't show up as options because they're duplicately named

think about how to put multiple things on a single grid square. probably have 2 grids- one for tiles, one for entities. And entities definitely need to be able to stack

moving can be transparent or non-transparent (checkbox to choose?)

implement dragging as lifting all grid elems up into a new "grid" that you then drag around, and it gets pasted back down when you unclick

    maybe implement grid as coord_map (set:map::coord_set:coord_map)

add listeners for:
    oncopy
    oncut
    onpaste

add steam/ND/data/level/ and steam/ND/data/traps/ sprites

low priority:
    interpolate between mouse events so you don't skip (e.g. placing rails in minecraft)
    add alternate names (e.g. "beetle" for "skeletontank")
        nvm skeletank is just extra... ugh
        filter out stuff like this?
    make select rectangles highlight _the sprite_, not just the square
    ctrl+a
