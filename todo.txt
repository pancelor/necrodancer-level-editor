choose what to do when you try to drag off-grid... probably just don't let it happen. awkward because now selections have to know about the grid again...
    well they kinda do already... (PIX)

double click on the toolbar = flood fill selection

ctrl+a

implement dragging as lifting all grid elems up into a new "grid" that you then drag around, and it gets pasted back down when you unclick

    maybe implement grid as coord_map (set:map::coord_set:coord_map)

add listeners for:
    oncopy
    oncut
    onpaste

low priority:
    interpolate between mouse events so you don't skip (e.g. placing rails in minecraft)
